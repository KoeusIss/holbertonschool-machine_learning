## Deep Q-learning
Deep Q-learning project builds a gaming agent can play Atari's Breakout, The model
is built to train the agent for 1000000 steps.

## Learning Objectives

* What is Deep Q-learning?
* What is the policy network?
* What is replay memory?
* What is the target network?
* Why must we utilize two separate networks during training?
* What is keras-rl? How do you use it?

## How it works
In order to see the agent in action, you can either use the provided weights, by entering
```bash
./play.py --mode play
```
or You can train it for yourself by typing
```bash
./play.py --mode train
```
